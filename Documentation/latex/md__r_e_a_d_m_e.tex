The purpose of this project is to display the date and the time on the L\+CD screen which was previously introduced by the user. To achieve this goal it was use a general 4x4 matrix keypad to introduce the data; the R\+TC D\+S1307 to set the date and time via the I2C bus; and to display the different parameters it was use the H\+D44780 controller along with the P\+C\+F8574 I2C I/O expander.

Before begin with this project it was necessary to develop the drivers for each component, which you can find them in my other repositories.

In this application every time the M\+CU is powered on, the program will ask for the current date and time. Once this is done it will display the data on the L\+CD screen updating the time every second. It is also provided an extra button if at some point the user wants to change the values again.

This project was tested on the \href{https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html}{\texttt{ S\+T\+M32\+D\+I\+S\+C\+O\+V\+E\+RY}} board.
